# 👋 Hi, I'm Burak Can Topluoğlu

I'm a multilingual data enthusiast with hands-on experience in business development, market research, and data analysis — blending people, processes, and platforms into insights that matter.

After completing dual internships in France as a Data Analyst, I’ve worked on projects ranging from CRM data cleaning and dashboard design to market entry analysis in industrial and medical sectors. My tools of choice include Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel.

I'm passionate about helping teams make smarter decisions using clean data and actionable insights. My current focus is on Business Analysis roles where I can bring both technical and communication skills into play.
